 *   - Astro *resolves to the wrong copy* — a hoisted sibling pinned an older
 *     major (e.g. `astro@6` for a type-only import) that shadows Blume's
 *     `astro@7`, so `@astrojs/mdx@7` binds to it and crashes the build on a
 *     missing export. Resolving merely *an* astro isn't enough; it must be the
 *     same one Blume uses.
 *   - The *integrations* are unreachable while astro is fine — npm's split
 *     install. An `overrides` pin plus an incremental `npm install` hoists
 *     astro to the project root (deleting Blume's nested copy) but leaves
 *     `@astrojs/mdx` and friends nested under `blume/node_modules`, where the
 *     upward walk from `.blume/` can't see them. The same shape arises under
 *     an isolated linker when the workspace itself declares astro at a version
 *     matching Blume's: the store dedupes both to one copy, so the walk finds
 *     the "correct" astro through the workspace's own direct-dep symlink — in
 *     a node_modules holding none of Blume's other deps.
 *
 * The repair is the same symlink: Blume's dependency directory linked in as
 * `.blume/node_modules` so the generated config's bare specifiers (`astro`,
 * `@astrojs/mdx`, …) bind to a consistent set. That's safe when the linked
 * directory holds the full set, or when it holds only the integrations but the
 * runtime already resolves Blume's astro — the junction has no `astro` entry,
 * so astro lookups fall through to the hoisted copy the integrations bind to
 * anyway. What it can't fix is the inverse split: Blume's astro nested under a
 * *conflicting* hoisted astro with the integrations hoisted away from it. No
 * single directory yields a consistent set there; only a root `overrides`/
 * `resolutions` pin does, so we return a diagnostic naming the conflict rather
 * than silently shipping a runtime that crashes downstream. Returns the
